## Hello world 👋🏾!

I am Laura Mugeha, a Geospatial engineer and technical community builder working at the intersection of open data, free and open-source software, and sustainable development. I currently work at a Kenyan social enterprise to support teams to adopt data for good. In my free time, I volunteer with tech communities.
 
- 🔭 I'm currently working on building a data for good consultancy. It is an exciting journey that constantly fuels my curiosity and creativity.
- 📚 I'm also re-learning data science, It's a field that promises endless possibilities, and I can't wait to unlock its potential to make the world a better place.
- 🤝 I'm looking to support open-source communities in Africa. Collaborating with passionate individuals who share the same values and are driven to make a difference is what truly fuels my passion.
- 💬 Need help integrating captivating maps into your work? I've got you covered! Ask me anything about working with maps and geospatial data to enhance your projects.
- 👩🏾 Pronouns: she, her, hers
- ⚡ Fun fact: When it comes to choosing between music and coffee, it's quite the dilemma for me. If I'm seeking an energy boost, I have to pick one or the other. But hey, if the goal is to have an impromptu dance party in my chair, then you bet I'll have both!<br>
